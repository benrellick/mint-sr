# Add Savings Rate to Mint

This is a Google Chrome extension that adds savings rate to the budget page. You can [add it to chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/add-savings-rate-to-mint/cjeejgphhadidhggfjfpoceagbephnfo?hl=en) from the google chrome webstore.

## Issues / future considerations
1. Only calculates SR based on expenses and income in mint. It doesn't account for pre-tax contributions that may not show up on the budget page. It doesn't take goals into consideration, since presumably they're also being saved.
